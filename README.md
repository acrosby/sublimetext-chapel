# sublimetext-chapel
Currently, Cray Chapel syntax highlighting and some basic snippets for Sublime Text editor.

More snippets, and Chapel compiler (`chpl`) build scenarios could be easily added. PR's will be accepted, because I won't be working on this full time.

The syntax description is taken from the now official @chapel-lang 's chapel-tmbundle (https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-tmbundle) which is keeping (only) the textmate syntax description up-to-date.

Currently, this syntax description from https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel-tmbundle/commit/8e8f4f6e8b4c2a126181ea64fb6f181650a97dac
