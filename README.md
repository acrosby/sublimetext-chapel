# sublimetext-chapel
Currently, Cray Chapel syntax highlighting for Sublime Text editor

Snippets, and Chapel compiler (`chpl`) build scenarios could be easily added. PR's will be accepted, because I won't be working on this full time.

The syntax description is taken from @bholt's chapel-tmbundle (https://github.com/bholt/chapel-tmbundle)
